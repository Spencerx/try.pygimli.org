        "Task:\n    Construct a mesh with arbitrary geometry, boundaries and regions for\n    computations in GIMLi.\nProblem:\n    For complex geometries, mesh construction using the poly tools can be\n    cumbersome and lacks of straightforward visual inspection.\nSolution:\n    Create the mesh in Gmsh, a 3D finite element mesh generator with\n    parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities, and convert it\n    to GIMLi for subsequent modelling and inversion.\n\nWhen the scientific task requires a complex finite-element discretization\n(i.e. incorporation of structural information, usage of a complete electrode\nmodel (CEM), etc.), external meshing tools with visualization capabilities\nmay be the option of choice for some users. In general, the bindings provided\nby pygimli allow to interface any external mesh generation software.\n\nThis HowTo presents an example using Gmsh :cite:`GeuzaineRemacle2009`. Gmsh\nallows for parametric input, i.e. physical boundaries and regions (and any\nother input) can be specified interactively using the graphical user\ninterface or Gmsh's own scripting language. A lot of profound tutorials can\nbe found on the Gmsh website (http://www.gmsh.info) or elsewhere.\nHere, a crosshole ERT example with geological a priori information is\npresented with a focus on the usage in GIMLi.\n\nGeometry\n---------\n\nWe start with the definition of several points to layout the main geometry. A\npoint is created via the graphical user interface as illustrated in the\nfollowing figure.\n\n.. figure:: ../../_static/gmsh/create_point.png\n    :align: center\n\n    Steps to create a point via the graphical user interface.\n\nWe create a large domain to solve the forward problem and specify the\ncoordinates as well as a characteristic length to\nconstrain the relative size of the mesh elements at that point (this is also\nuseful for near-electrode refinement for example).\n\n.. figure:: ../../_static/gmsh/bbox_coordinate.png\n    :width: 75 %\n    :align: center\n\n    Setting the parameters of a point.\n\nIn the geometry file being created, this step would correspond the following\ncommand.\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Point(1) = {-5000, 0, 0, cl1};\n\nDuring this HowTo, we will switch between the GUI input and the scripting\nlanguage. Gmsh's reload button allows for quick and straightforward\ninteraction between both modes.\n\nNote that it is convenient to replace the characteristic length by a variable\nDuring this HowTo, we will switch between the GUI input and the scripting\nlanguage. Subsequent to the definition of the corner points, we can set up\nthe boundaries by connecting the points created, as shown below.\n\n.. figure:: ../../_static/gmsh/line.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 75 %\n\n    Connecting geometric points using straight lines.\n\nThe corresponding command in the script to connect points 1 and 5 would look\nlike this:\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Line(1) = {1, 5};\n\nObviously, we also have to define the electrode positions:\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    For i In {0:9}\n    Point(newp) = {15,0,-4*(i+2),cl2}; // Borehole 1\n    Point(newp) = {35,0,-4*(i+2),cl2}; // Borehole 2\n    EndFor\n\nSimilarly, we define a set of points describing a geological body and connect\nthem with a spline curve:\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Spline(100) = {31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,\n                41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 29, 30, 31};\n\nAfter the definition of all points and lines, we can define the three\nsurfaces. A surface is created by selecting *Plane Surface* from the menu and\nclicking on the bounding lines and the holes (if present). The following\nfigure illustrates the definition of the outer surface.\n\n.. figure:: ../../_static/gmsh/surf1.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 75 %\n\n    Creating a surface by clicking on the boundaries.\n\nWhen the surfaces (or volumes in 3D) have been defined, the mesh can be\ngenerated by simply clicking the 2D button in the mesh menu (*Mesh -\n2D*). As you will notice, the electrodes are not located on node points, as\nthey # do not layout any geometric feature. To change this, we can embed them\nin the surfaces (*Mesh - Define - Embedded Points*) or directly in the script\nvia:\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Point{10, 12, 14, ..., 17, 23, 25, 27} In Surface{106};\n    Point{18, 19, 21} In Surface{104}; // electrodes within the target\n\nBoundaries and regions\n----------------------\n\nSince Gmsh allows for parametric input, we can finally specify the boundary\nconditions and region marker. This is done in the *Physical Groups*\nsection under Geometry. The group numbers can be changed within the script.\nNumber 1 is assigned to a Neumann-type boundary condition and number 2 to a\nmixed one.\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Physical Line(1) = {3, 2, 1}; // Free surface\n    Physical Line(2) = {4, 5, 6}; // Mixed boundary conditions\n\nThe indices of the regions will directly map to the region marker in BERT.\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Physical Surface(1) = {102}; // Outer region\n    Physical Surface(2) = {106}; // Inversion region\n    Physical Surface(3) = {104}; // Geological body\n\nFinally, we assign all electrodes to a Physical Group with the marker 99.\n\n.. code-block:: c++\n\n    Physical Point(99) = {9, 11, ..., 24, 26, 28}; // electrode marker (99)\n\nThat's it! Now, you can re-run the meshing algorithm and save the result.\n\nNote that in addition to the characteristic length at each point, there are\nmany different ways to constrain the element size (in general or locally) and\nthe resulting mesh quality, which will not be discussed here.\n\nThe final geometry can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/gimli-org/example-data/blob/master/gmsh/2d_tutorial.geo>`_\nand meshed in the GUI or via the command:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    gmsh -2 -o mesh.msh mesh.geo\n\nImport to GIMLi\n---------------\n\nAny Gmsh output (2D and 3D) can be imported using pygimli and subsequently\nsaved to the binary format.\n\n"
