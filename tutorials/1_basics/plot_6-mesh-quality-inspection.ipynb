        "\nQuality of unstructured meshes\n==============================\n\n**Problem:**\n\n    Accurate numerical solutions require high quality meshes. In the case of\n    unstructured triangular meshes (or tetrahedral meshes in 3D), relatively\n    large and small angles can lead to discretization errors. Large angles can\n    cause interpolation errors, while small angles can lead to ill-conditioned\n    stiffness matrices.\n\n**Identification:**\n\n    Some common 2D quality measures are\n    implemented in :mod:`pygimli.meshtools` and will be used in this tutorial.\n    In 3D, we recommend to export the mesh in VTK format and inspect mesh\n    quality with ParaView (Filters -> Alphapetical -> Mesh quality).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n    Meshes can be improved by adjusting cell sizes (`area` keyword) and the\n    minimum allowed angle (`quality` keyword). :term:`Gmsh` and other more\n    advanced meshing tools also provide powerful mesh optimization algorithms.\n    However, the numerical accurary may be improved at the expense of increased\n    cell counts and thus longer computation times.\n"

        "Quality measures\n----------------\n\nThere are numerous measures related to the area/volume, boundary lengths and\nangles of a cell (see [#f1]_ for a review). A straightforward measure\nconsiders the minimum angle in a triangle (normalized by 60 degrees). More\nsophisticated measures also take into account the cell size. A very common\nmeasure, often referred to as $\\eta$, relates the area of a triangle\n$a$ to its edge lengths $l_1,l_2,l_3$.\n\n\\begin{align}\\eta = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}a}{l_1^2 + l_2^2 + l_3^2}\\end{align}\n\nThe normalization factor $4\\sqrt{3}$ ensures that a perfect triangle\n(equal edges) has a quality of 1. A popular measure also applicable for other\ncell types is the *Normalized shape ratio (NSR)*, which relates the\ncircumradius $R$ to the inradius of cell ($r$).\n\n\\begin{align}\\rho = \\frac{2r}{R}\\end{align}\n\nAgain the factor 2 (3 in 3D) ensures that a perfect triangle has a quality of\n1, whereas a flat triangle would have a quality of 0. The above mentioned\nquality measures are plotted below for the same mesh.\n\n"
